We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information. However, the App may process limited data necessary for its functionality, including:

- **Nutritional Data**: When you log your food intake, the App processes and calculates macronutrient values (carbohydrates, protein, and fats).

## 5. Data Sharing and Transfers

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties. However, we may use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) to improve app performance. These third parties may collect anonymized data in compliance with their respective privacy policies.

## 6. Data Retention

We do not store any personal data on our servers. All macronutrient logs and user preferences are stored locally on your device unless you choose to back up your data to a third-party cloud service (e.g., Google Drive or iCloud).

## 7. AI-Generated Insights Disclaimer

Any insights, calculations, or recommendations provided by the App are **AI-generated** and should be used for informational purposes only. They are **not a substitute for professional medical or dietary advice**. Always consult a qualified nutritionist or healthcare provider before making significant dietary changes.

We are not responsible for any consequences resulting from reliance on the AI-generated insights. Use the App at your own risk.

We take appropriate security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure, including:

- Secure storage of locally saved data on your device.
- Encryption of data in transit.
- Regular security assessments of third-party analytics providers.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is entirely secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
